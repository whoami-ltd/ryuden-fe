# RyudenHub - Gaming Hub Platform

## Project Overview
RyudenHub is a comprehensive gaming hub platform that provides multiple game resources, community features, and tools to enhance the gaming experience. The platform serves as a central hub for gamers to access game information, guides, AI coaching, tracking systems, and community forums.

## Core Features & Vision
- **Game Resources**: Integration with multiple 3rd party gaming APIs and OAuth providers
- **Game Information**: Lore, guides, updates, patches, system requirements, PS5 trophies
- **AI Coaching**: Intelligent coaching and guidance systems
- **Tracking Systems**: Player progress, statistics, and achievement tracking
- **Community Forums**: User-generated content, Q&A, experience sharing
- **Game Tools**: Interactive maps, guides, and utility tools (similar to MapGenie, Tracker.gg)
- **Central Gaming Hub**: One-stop destination for all gaming needs

## Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode, no 'any' types)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Icons**: Lucide React icons
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui for reusable components
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useReducer, useContext)
- **Authentication**: OAuth integration with multiple providers

## Code Standards & Preferences

### File Naming & Structure
- Use kebab-case for all file names and folder names
- Split React code into separate components instead of single files
- Organize components by feature/domain
- Use absolute imports with proper path mapping

### TypeScript Guidelines
- Avoid using 'any' types - use proper type definitions
- Use strict TypeScript configuration

### Component Architecture
- Build reusable, composable components using Shadcn/ui
- Create intuitive design system with consistent spacing, colors, and typography
- Implement proper component props interfaces
- Use proper error boundaries and loading states

### State Management
- Use React's built-in hooks: useState, useReducer, useContext
- Create custom hooks for complex state logic
- Use useReducer for complex state updates with multiple actions
- Use Context API for sharing state across components
- Keep state as close to where it's used as possible

### UI/UX Principles
- Focus on intuitive design and excellent user experience
- Implement responsive design for all screen sizes
- Use consistent spacing, typography, and color schemes
- Implement smooth animations with Framer Motion

### API Integration
- Design for multiple 3rd party API integrations
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Use proper TypeScript interfaces for API responses
- Implement OAuth flows for various gaming platforms

### Performance Considerations
- Implement proper code splitting and lazy loading
- Optimize images and assets
- Use Next.js built-in optimizations
- Implement proper caching strategies

## Development Guidelines

### Component Development
- Always create reusable components when possible
- Use proper TypeScript interfaces for props
- Implement proper error handling
- Add loading states for async operations
- Use Lucide icons consistently

### Styling Approach
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Create custom design tokens for consistency
- Implement dark/light mode support
- Use proper responsive breakpoints

### Animation Guidelines
- Use Framer Motion for smooth, performant animations
- Implement micro-interactions for better UX
- Use consistent animation timing and easing
- Avoid over-animation that impacts performance

### Data Management
- Implement proper data fetching patterns
- Use React Query or SWR for server state
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Handle loading and error states gracefully

## Gaming Platform Integration
- Design for multiple gaming platforms (Steam, PlayStation, Xbox, Epic, etc.)
- Implement proper OAuth flows for each platform
- Handle different API response formats and rate limits
- Implement proper error handling for API failures

## Community Features
- Design forum components with proper threading
- Implement user profiles and reputation systems
- Create content moderation tools
- Design responsive forum layouts

## Quality Assurance
- Write comprehensive TypeScript types
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Add loading states for all async operations
- Test responsive design across devices

## Future Considerations
- Design for scalability and performance
- Plan for internationalization (i18n)
- Consider offline functionality where appropriate
- Design for easy addition of new gaming platforms
- Plan for analytics and user tracking

Remember: This is a long-term project that will evolve. Focus on building a solid foundation with reusable components, proper architecture, and excellent user experience. Always prioritize code quality, performance, and maintainability.
